    The Army had half a day. Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! A trick is something a whore does for money ... or candy ... or cocaine.

    We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. It feels good to be back in a queen! Please refrain from Mayoneggs during this salmonella scare. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!!

    Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it.

    Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Oh ... yeah ... the guy in the ... the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Shemale.

    It walked on my pillow! I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.)

    And THAT'S why you always leave a note. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. That coat costs more than your house! It's ok. You be with Yam. Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores.
